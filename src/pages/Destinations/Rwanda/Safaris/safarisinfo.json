Unlike most other countries on Africa's safari circuit, it is relatively small in area, it supports a greater amount of forest than savannah, and its number one attraction is primate watching. Volcanoes National Park is probably the best place anywhere to track mountain gorillas, a bucket-list activity that many would regard to be the world's most engaging wildlife encounter. Other activities offered in Rwanda include chimp trekking, golden monkey trekking and forest walks in biodiverse Nyungwe National Park. Furthermore, while Rwanda isn't widely associated with the Big Five, its underrated Akagera National Park is now home to the full deck of lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, black rhino and white rhino.",
