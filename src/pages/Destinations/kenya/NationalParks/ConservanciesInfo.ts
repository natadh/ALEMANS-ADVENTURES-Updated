        content: `Kenya has about 110 wildlife conservancies, all promoting the placid co-existence of people and wildlife in mutual well-being. Solio Ranch, Taita Hills Sanctuary, Kimama Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Ol Chorro Oiroua Ranch were among the trailblazers. Improved security, better land management, income, employment and support to community projects have all encouraged the rise of conservancies in Kenya, spread across 22 counties and covering over 7.56 million acres.
Conservancies provide a range of local values including clarifying and firming up local land tenure over pasture and grazing areas, improving the security through networks of community scouts, timely communication and law enforcement infrastructure, and providing a legal systems for communities to enter into 3rd-party joint ventures with investors in order to generate revenues.

        header: "Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary",
        content: `The Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary(THWS) derives its name from the surrounding clusters of hills and is an integral part of the Eastern Arc forests classified as a biodiversity hotspot. Before the establishment of THWS on Bura Block along Mwatate-Taveta Road, the land was used as a game hunting ground. THWS was established in 1970 to make the area more attractive to wildlife and tourists, allow conservation, and promote wildlife viewing. The sanctuary covers an area of 28,000 acres of mosaic habitat where the plant physiognomy is riverine forest, savanna wood and grassland. The vegetation formation is usually dense, stratified and always dominated by Acacia /Commiphora trees and may appear to be evergreen in wet areas such as in the central lowlands of the sanctuary. More than 50 species of large mammals and 300 species of birds have been recorded in THWS.
The sanctuary straddles the Southern Tsavo West National Park and is an important dispersal area and migrating corridor for wildlife between Tsavo East National Park and Tsavo West National Park and making it a highly valued tourism recreational area and of ecological importance. The topography is generally mountainous that offers breath taking landscape views of the Kilimanjaro, Pare, Uluguru mountains and the clusters of Taita Hills with a seasonal river dividing the sanctuary into valleys and lowland plains.
Encompassing forests, mountains, rivers and grasslands, lines up against the vast Tsavo West National Park and is a vital biodiversity hot spot. As well as classic game drives, there are dedicated bird-watching safaris and conservation programs that guests can join.

It’s known for having one of the densest populations of lions in Africa (as well as all the other cats). The landscape ranges from wide-open grasslands to light bush, both of which attract plenty of elephants. There are lots of activities on offer here, including walking and bush-camping safaris, that cannot be done in the nearby national reserve. Mara Naboisho runs a highly regarded community-development program.`,

        header: "Mara North Conservancy",
        content: `The area now known as the Mara North Conservancy was in extremely poor state back in the 1980s and 1990s. Ownership of the land was highly fragmented and the fencing between land boundaries caused major barriers for local and migrating wildlife. Overgrazing by the Maasai’s cattle caused degeneration of the land and threatened the future of the landowners. In 2009 a group of over 800 Maasai landowners joined together to save their land and livelihood by establishing the 320 km2 Mara North Conservancy. Thanks to the conservancy's conservation efforts and partnerships with lodges and safari organizations, the area’s wildlife is booming and the Maasai landowners have a brighter future ahead.
Geography & wildlife
Long golden grass and whimsical flat-topped acacia trees, the conservancy’s landscape is exactly as you would expect it to be. Thanks to conservation efforts such as natural environment regeneration and protection of wildlife from poaching and traps by wildlife rangers the conservancy now had one of the highest concentrations of wildlife in the Mara ecosystem. Aside from the Big 5 there are over 450 species of birds to spot, several species of antelopes gracing the plains and a variety of animals that seem to have stepped straight out of a story book.
The eastern side of the plains feature a network of wooded valleys and seasonal streams known as ‘luggas’. The area’s riverine forests are an emerald-hued refuge for the conservancy’s elephants, baboons, giraffes and hippos. To the west, forested hillsides flank the croc-infested waters of the Mara River with the towering Olooloo Escarpment rising up in the background.
From Leopard Gorge, a secluded big cat maternity ward, to the scenic Lemek Hills, a refuge for endangered African wild dogs, the conservancy’s location and landscape make it a first-class safari destination. During the months December – May, the conservancy is home to the Loita Hills migration. During this lesser known, yet still incredibly impressive migration, thousands of local wildebeest trek through the Mara North Conservancy.
The Great Migration in Mara North Conservancy
Chances of seeing the big African cats in action are even greater during the Great Migration. During this ultimate trek of herd animals, the local big cats are often out and about in search of their next easy meal. You will be able to see quite a bit of the Great Migration from within the Mara North Conservancy during the dry season from July - October. Migrating herds of wildebeest and zebras that continue on from the Mara Triangle and the reserve, and push further north, pass through the conservancy. However, for the more dramatic Mara River crossings you’ll have to travel south to the Mara Triangle or Masai Mara National Reserve.

Accommodation in Mara North Conservancy
There are only twelve safari lodges scattered throughout the Mara North conservancy. Among the accommodation options are idyllic boutique lodges and luxurious tented camps. Each of the accommodations follow the conservancy’s strict environmental policies to ensure they have little negative impact on the environment. A few of the measures taken by the accommodations are the use of: solar panels, eco-friendly products, compost systems for organic waste and water saving systems. Each accommodation contributes to the wellbeing of the entire Maasai community. The monthly fees paid by the accommodations are used to support education, health and women’s entrepreneurship.
During your stay in the conservancy, your accommodation will offer a variety of safari activities. Generally you’ll be able to choose from off-road driving, walking safaris, bush meals and after-dark jeep safaris. Due to the exclusive nature of the conservancy, you’ll likely encounter very few other vehicles during a game drive. In most cases your lodge or tented camp will also offer opportunities to interact with the colorfully dressed Maasai.

        content: `Solio Ranch Conservancy is probably one of Kenya’s most remarkable wildlife sanctuaries, nestled between Mount Kenya and the Aberdare Mountains in the Greater Laikipia Region. This privately owned conservancy spreads over 17,500 acres and forms one of the most successful black rhino protection and breeding projects in the country. This is a chance to see great numbers of rhinos and lions in their natural habitat, something not commonly seen in most tourist destinations in Kenya, other than the Solio Ranch.
The Conservancy, from the famous rhino population found here, has all manner of wildlife, including lions, cheetahs, buffalo, zebras, and giraffes that roam freely across the open savannah, making a dynamic ecosystem where these iconic African species coexist. Solio Ranch also offers some of the finest leopard viewing in the country, adding to its excitement for both wildlife lovers and photographers alike. For the birder, the conservancy would prove equally tantalizing, with the great diversity of bird species counted here, making it one of the premium locations for the observation of avifauna.
Complemented further by the breathtaking scenery of Solio Ranch, it offers clear views of Mount Kenya, the second-highest peak in Africa. All this natural beauty frames a haven for wildlife. Serene landscapes and vibrant wildlife provide a tranquil yet thrilling environment that will appeal to nature lovers and adventurers alike.

Besides being an important haven for such rare species, it is also a testimony to private conservation work in practice. With the conservancy ensuring the safety of black rhinos while continuing to offer a haven for other wildlife species, Solio Ranch has emerged as an outstanding example for Kenyan and worldwide conservation initiatives. From the close encounters with the great beasts to a quiet retreat in the African wilderness, to a chance to appreciate the unique biodiversity of this region, Solio Ranch has something to offer.
