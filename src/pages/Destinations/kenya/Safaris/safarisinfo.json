Today, the train journey is a fascinating experience, passing through small towns and villages, over impressive viaducts and through tunnels. The train has several classes of travel, from basic second class to first class with air-conditioned carriages and sleeper berths. Meals are served in the dining car, and there is a bar car for drinks and snacks. The journey takes about 12 hours, and it is possible to break the journey with overnight stops at various points along the route.",
