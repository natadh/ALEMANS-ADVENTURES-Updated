Also imagine watching your cook prepare each and every meal as you watch and having the chance to show the group how good you are in the kitchen and having to share in the responsibilities of either cleaning the dishes or making the meals. Having spent the whole day watching different animals and their way of life e.g., the cats hunting and killing a prey and knowing you will be sleeping in the same bush with no fence or electricity and only having a flash light.
