It was from this Island that great African explorers, like Burton, Speke, Grant and Livingston, set out on their journeys of discovery. In the 18th Century the Island was a focus of the slave trade. The 'Stone Town' is steeped in history and in the north of the Island there are many superb beaches. Known as the Spice Island, it was the cloves that were particularly prized and Vasco da Gama took cargo back to Portugal after his voyage. Outside the town there are many places of interest to visit including the Maruhubi Palace - formerly the Sultan's harem, the Kidichi baths, Mangapwani Village, the former site of the notorious slave pits and Kizimkazi with its recently renovated 12th Century Persian Mosque. Access to Zanzibar is by air from Nairobi and Mombasa or by Hydrofoil from Dar es Salaam.",
